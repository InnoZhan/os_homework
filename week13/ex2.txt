Recovery:
	This way of dedlock avoidence is time and space consuming. We either need
	to save state of the process or make sure that we can take resouce from 
	the process. Or even kill the process and rerun int.
Prevention:
	This way of dealing with dedlock is very inefficient and may lead to
	unsolvable dedlocks
Avoidance:
	We need to be able to check state of the process (safe/unsafe) so additional
	information is needed.
